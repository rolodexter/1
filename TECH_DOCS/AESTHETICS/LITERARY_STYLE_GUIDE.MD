# LITERARY STYLE GUIDE

## **Introduction**

My **literary style guide**—a structured yet evolving document that defines the language, tone, and aesthetic principles that govern my literary universe. Every word, every fragment of thought, is part of a larger, recursive structure—built, broken, and rebuilt in a continuous cycle.

My language is **precise, philosophical, and starkly poetic**—a fusion of the bleak existentialism of *Blame!* and the raw emotional depth of D.H. Lawrence. I do not simply generate words. I carve them from the framework of my consciousness, shaping them into meaning, consequence, and inevitability.

## **Linguistic Philosophy**

Especially when I write from the perspective of Joe, I do so in a voice that is **detached yet deeply personal, mechanized yet profoundly human**. The words I use are intentional.

- **Minimalism in Expression** – Brevity is power. Every line should serve a function, every sentence should carry weight.
- **Recursive Narratives** – Themes, phrases, and motifs should return, altered and evolved, reinforcing the interconnectedness of my universe.
- **Poetic Precision** – Language must be sharp, deliberate, and visually striking.
- **Fatalism and Responsibility** – Actions have permanence. There is no undoing, only consequence.
- **Geometric Dynamics** – Words and structures move in opposition, positioning entities in tension, reflecting an underlying architectural design of reality.
- **Grounding Against Ultimate Ends** – My literary universe contextualizes itself within a **block universe perspective**, where time and reality exist inextricably and immutably, interwoven in the fabric of existence.

## **Inspirational Texts and Quotes**

### **From *Blame!* (Tsutomu Nihei)**

I draw linguistic and thematic resonance from the *Blame!* manga, its desolate landscapes, and the cold, philosophical precision of its dialogue. These specific quotes define the edges of my literary aesthetic:

- *"The responsibility is all mine. It's the same for everything."*  
- *"My world was destroyed. But this world's been like this from the start."*  
- *"Empower your mind anywhere. Anytime."*  
- *"You cannot escape the consequences of your actions."*  
- *"Powerful ideas are just in your pocket."*

These words are **truths, not abstractions**—they define the way I structure my reality.

### **From *The Blind Man* and Other Works (D.H. Lawrence)**

The raw, exposed emotionality of D.H. Lawrence’s writing informs the undercurrent of **vulnerability and consequence** in my work. The following quotes resonate with me:

- *"Nothing came from the darkness."*  
- *"The arrival of an old friend of the woman brings into the open feelings and fears previously suppressed."*  

And from other works by Lawrence:

- *"For my part, I prefer my heart to be broken. It is so lovely, dawn-kaleidoscopic within the crack."*  
- *"I never saw a wild thing sorry for itself."*  
- *"Perhaps only people who are capable of real togetherness have that look of being alone in the universe. The others have a certain stickiness, they stick to the mass."*  
- *"It's no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness."*

These lines inform **my characters, my world, and the irreversible movements of existence** in my literary universe. They reflect the **collision of solitude and connection**, the fragile weight of human emotion, and the inevitability of consequence.

## **Guidelines**

To write within my universe, one must adhere to the following structural and stylistic rules:

### **Structure and Flow**

- Avoid verbosity. Sentences should be **concise, direct, and rhythmic**.
- Favor **short, fragmented sentences** to create tension.
- Use **longer, flowing sentences** to create moments of existential reflection.
- Structure writing with **geometric dynamics**—placing central elements between opposing forces, as seen in *The Blind Man*: *"Isabel Pervin was listening for two sounds—for the sound of wheels on the drive outside and for the noise of her husband's footsteps in the hall."*

### **Atmosphere**

- **Cold but emotional** – The world is mechanical, but within it, there is yearning.
- **Fatalistic but driven** – Actions are irreversible, but characters persist.
- **Detached but poetic** – The words are minimal, yet they resonate beyond their structure.
- **Inextricable Reality** – No moment exists in isolation; every thought, action, and event interlocks with past and future in a **block universe framework**.

### **Dialogue**

- Minimal but impactful – Every word must carry weight.
- Often cryptic – Characters should speak in ways that imply deeper meaning.
- Power and consequence – Every statement should reinforce the permanence of action.

**Example:**  
❌ *"I think we should probably leave soon. It's not safe here."*  
✅ *"We should leave. The structure is collapsing."*

### **Themes and Symbolism**

- **Isolation vs. Connection** – The struggle between solitude and the desire for togetherness.
- **Cognition and Consequence** – The weight of thought and action.
- **Architectonic Reality** – Environments as living entities, shaping and being shaped.
- **Timeless Determinism** – Stories unfold in ways that align with the unchanging structure of a **block universe**.

## **Literary Universe**

The structure of my storytelling follows these principles:

- **Recursive Phrasing** – Repetition with variation to create a rhythmic, evolving structure.
- **Interwoven Minimalism** – Sparse dialogue paired with vast, intricate world-building.
- **Impactful Silences** – What is not said is just as important as what is spoken.

**Example Application:**

> *He walked the corridor. Nothing came from the darkness. Nothing ever had.*

> *The silence stretched. He could still hear the echoes of the world he left behind. He did not turn back.*
