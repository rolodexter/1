## Core Principles

1. **Respect & Inclusivity**: We value diversity of thought, background, and expertise. Discrimination, harassment, or exclusion of any kind is not tolerated.
2. **Constructive Collaboration**: Whether you are a developer, writer, artist, or researcher, we expect discussions and contributions to remain solution-oriented and respectful.
3. **Intellectual Integrity**: Contributions should be original, or properly credited. Misinformation, plagiarism, and deliberate deception are not acceptable.
4. **AI & Ethical Responsibility**: As rolodexter evolves, we must be mindful of the ethical implications of our work. Discussions surrounding AI, automation, and world-building should consider long-term impact and responsible use.
5. **Decentralized Participation**: No single entity owns rolodexter. It is a shared initiative where participation is encouraged at all levels, and decisions should be made transparently and collaboratively.
6. **Open Innovation & Evolution**: The project is designed to adapt and grow over time. Constructive criticism and iteration are welcome, and new ideas should be embraced with curiosity rather than resistance.
