By January 2025, countries are expected to submit their updated [Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs) aligned with the [Paris Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement) and the results of the first \[Global StocktakeEVOLUTIONARY\_LEAP.mdmd).

2. The [earnings test limit](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/EARNINGS_TEST_LIMIT.md) for Social Security recipients under [full retirement age](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/misc/phi4.md) will increase.
