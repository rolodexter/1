# Quantum Encryption

[Quantum encryption](quantum_encryption.md), also known as [quantum cryptography](../QUANTUM_CRYPTOGRAPHY.md), represents a revolutionary approach to securing information by leveraging the principles of [quantum mechanics](../QUANTUM_MECHANICS.md). This technology stands at the intersection of [quantum computing](broken-reference), [information security](../INFORMATION_SECURITY.md), and [military communications](../MILITARY_COMMUNICATIONS.md).

## Core Principles

### Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)

[QKD](../QUANTUM_KEY_DISTRIBUTION.md) forms the backbone of quantum encryption, utilizing the following quantum mechanical principles:

1. [**Quantum Superposition**](../QUANTUM_SUPERPOSITION.md)
   * Quantum bits (qubits) exist in multiple states simultaneously
   * Measurement collapses the superposition, revealing one definite state
   * This property makes intercepting quantum communications detectable
2. [**Quantum Entanglement**](../QUANTUM_ENTANGLEMENT.md)
   * Paired particles maintain correlated states regardless of distance
   * Changes to one particle instantly affect its entangled partner
   * Enables secure key distribution between distant parties

## Military Applications

### Strategic Communications

1. **Submarine Communications**
   * [Quantum-secured channels](../QUANTUM_CHANNELS.md) for nuclear submarine fleets
   * Resistant to traditional interception methods
   * Integration with existing [nuclear command and control](../NUCLEAR_COMMAND_CONTROL.md) systems
2. **Satellite Communications**
   * [Space-based quantum networks](../SPACE_QUANTUM_NETWORKS.md)
   * Secure communication links between ground stations and satellites
   * Protection against [space-based threats](../SPACE_THREATS.md)
