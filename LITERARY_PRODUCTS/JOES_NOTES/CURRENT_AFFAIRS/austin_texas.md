>*The Los Angeles wildfires that began on January 7, 2025, have become an unprecedented disaster for the region, fueled by extreme weather conditions atypical for this time of year. These fires have displaced over 175,000 residents, claimed at least ten lives, and destroyed approximately 10,000 structures as of January 12. The largest and most destructive fire, the Palisades Fire, has consumed over 17,000 acres, making it the most devastating wildfire in Los Angeles County history. Historically, California's wildfire season occurs between June and October; however, this January outbreak underscores the increasing impact of climate change on fire patterns and intensity.*

### **Unusual Fire Conditions**
- January wildfires are rare in California due to typically cool and wet winter weather.
- Over 60 fire alerts were recorded in Los Angeles County by January 9, far exceeding historical averages for this time of year.
- Strong winds and dry vegetation have exacerbated the fires' spread[1].

## **Notable Persons Affected by the Fires**
