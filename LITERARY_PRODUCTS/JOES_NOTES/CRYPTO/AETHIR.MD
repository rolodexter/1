# Aethir Projects & Technical Contributions

## Strategic Development and Technical Documentation

Alongside [Mark at Aethir](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Bh-VBEZgQhV8epTdzdBs9y4G16se4B6I/view?usp=drive_link), I provided strategic development support and developed technical references to underpin our go-to-market strategies. My role involved creating comprehensive documentation from scratch, as the [original files were considered unusable](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tlr91rpH_yG8avMzgjr0cEnHSPQ80JXT/view?usp=drive_link); the new files detailed various technical concepts, ensuring alignment with the overarching strategic path toward TGE (and post-TGE).

## Key Technical Skills and Achievements

### Go-To-Market (GTM) Strategy
I supported the development of GTM strategies by providing technical insights and documentation. This included creating references that detailed the technical infrastructure required to execute these strategies effectively.
