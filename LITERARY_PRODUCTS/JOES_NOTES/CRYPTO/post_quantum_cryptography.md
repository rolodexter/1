# Post-Quantum Cryptography

## Overview
**Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)** refers to cryptographic algorithms designed to resist attacks from quantum computers. With the advent of quantum computing, many current cryptographic systems, particularly those relying on asymmetric cryptography (e.g., RSA, ECC), are vulnerable to being broken. PQC aims to secure data and communications in a post-quantum era by developing quantum-resistant algorithms.

## **Threats Posed by Quantum Computing**

### 1. **Shor’s Algorithm:**
   - Capable of factoring large integers and computing discrete logarithms efficiently, breaking RSA and ECC.

### 2. **Grover’s Algorithm:**
   - Speeds up brute-force attacks on symmetric cryptographic systems, effectively halving their key strength.

### 3. **Long-Term Data Risks:**
   - Encrypted data captured today can be stored and decrypted later when quantum computers become powerful enough (known as the **“harvest now, decrypt later”** attack).
