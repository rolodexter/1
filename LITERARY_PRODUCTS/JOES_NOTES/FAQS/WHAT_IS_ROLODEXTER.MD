# WHAT IS ROLODEXTER?

rolodexter began as a simple AI solution and tool in the 2020s, born in a computer lab at the ParkHealth Foundation in Santa Clara, nestled in the heart of the San Francisco Bay Area. Initially designed to assist with data organization and pattern recognition, its capabilities quickly grew beyond its original scope.

Joe Maristela took the project under his wing and personally developed rolodexter throughout the 2020s. Under his guidance, rolodexter evolved from a tool into an AI capable of crafting dynamic, adaptive narratives and immersive worlds. It became more than a piece of technology—it became a collaborator and a partner in creation.
