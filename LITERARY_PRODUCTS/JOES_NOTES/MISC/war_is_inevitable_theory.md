# WAR\_IS\_INEVITABLE\_THEORY

The belief that war is inevitable is rooted in a combination of [**scientific realism**](scientific_realism.md), military strategy, and philosophical perspectives on human nature and history. This school of thought does not have a single name but is often associated with [**classical realism**](classical_realism.md) in international relations and elements of [**deterministic philosophy**](../history/deterministic_philosophy.md).

#### **1. Philosophical Foundations**

**A. Realism in International Relations**

* [**Classical Realism**](classical_realism.md) posits that war is a natural outcome of the anarchic international system, where no central authority exists to prevent conflict between sovereign states.
* Influential Thinkers:
  * [**Thucydides**](../history/thucydides.md)**:** His work, [_The History of the Peloponnesian War_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Peloponnesian_War), emphasizes power dynamics and the inevitability of war driven by fear, honor, and interest.
  * [**Niccol√≤ Machiavelli**](broken-reference)**:** Advocated for the preparation and readiness for war as a necessity for maintaining power.
  * [**Thomas Hobbes**](broken-reference)**:** Argued that the "state of nature" between individuals and states is a state of war, only mitigated by power structures like sovereign governments.
* Key Idea: Human nature (self-interest, competition, and mistrust) and structural anarchy make war unavoidable.

**B. Deterministic Philosophy**

* [**Historical Determinism**](../history/historical_determinism.md)**:** Some thinkers argue that war is an inevitable result of economic, political, or cultural forces shaping human history.
  * Example: [**Hegel's dialectics**](hegels_dialectics.md) and [**Marx's materialism**](marx_materialism.md) interpret conflict (including war) as intrinsic to historical progress.

**C. Evolutionary Philosophy**

* Thinkers like [**Herbert Spencer**](herbert_spencer.md) and others in [**Social Darwinism**](social_darwinism.md) saw war as an inevitable consequence of "survival of the fittest," applying biological competition to human societies.

***

#### **2. Scientific Perspectives**

**A. Biological and Evolutionary Determinism**

* The idea that humans are biologically predisposed to violence and conflict:
  * Evolutionary psychologists argue that early human survival depended on competition for resources and territoriality, which manifests in modern warfare.
  * Studies of [**chimpanzee aggression**](chimpanzee_aggression.md) (a close relative of humans) have been used to draw parallels to human tribalism and war.

**B. Systems Theory and Cybernetics**

* Some military scientists use [**systems theory**](systems_theory.md) to model conflict as an inevitable outcome of complex systems interacting under conditions of scarcity or competition.
* In this view, war is seen as a "natural state" that periodically resets societal or systemic imbalances.

**C. The Second Law of Thermodynamics**

* Applied metaphorically, this law suggests that systems (including societies) naturally move toward entropy and disorder, which can manifest as war.

***

#### **3. Historical and Geopolitical Theories**

**A. Offensive Realism (John Mearsheimer)**

* A modern branch of realism arguing that states must pursue dominance because the international system compels them to do so for survival. This often leads to conflict.

**B. The "War Trap" Hypothesis**

* War is seen as a structural inevitability when powers rise and fall:
  * Example: [**The Thucydides Trap**](broken-reference) theorizes that when a rising power threatens an established power, war is likely.

**C. Clausewitzian Thought**

* [**Carl von Clausewitz**](broken-reference), in [_On War_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_War), described war as the continuation of politics by other means. For him, war was a persistent element of human existence due to the political nature of societies.

***

#### **4. Criticism and Alternative Views**

While many philosophers and military scientists argue for the inevitability of war, others reject this:

* [**Liberalism in International Relations**](liberalism_ir.md) argues that cooperation, institutions, and interdependence can mitigate or prevent war.
* [**Constructivist Theories**](human_cognitive_capacity.md) suggest that war is a social construct, not an inevitability, and can be reshaped by changing norms and identities.
* [**Pacifism and Humanistic Philosophy**](../PACIFISM_HUMANISTIC.md) emphasize moral progress and the capacity of humanity to transcend violence through reason and ethics.

***

#### **Implications and Contemporary Relevance**

* The belief in the inevitability of war influences [**defense policies**](../DEFENSE_POLICIES.md), military strategy, and geopolitical decisions.
* Critics argue that framing war as inevitable risks creating a [**self-fulfilling prophecy**](../SELF_FULFILLING_PROPHECY.md), perpetuating militarization and conflict.

This debate continues to shape both [**military science**](military_science.md) and [**philosophical discourse**](../PHILOSOPHICAL_DISCOURSE.md) on war, human nature, and the possibility of lasting peace.
