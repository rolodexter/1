# Timeline of UAP/UFO Psyops

This timeline illustrates how the U.S. government's engagement with UAPs and UFO phenomena has often been intertwined with psychological operations aimed at influencing public perception, managing fear, and concealing advanced military technologies. Each event reflects a broader strategy of using disinformation as a tool for psychological manipulation throughout nearly eight decades.

## **1940s**

* **1947**:
  * [**Roswell Incident**](broken-reference): An object crashes in New Mexico, initially reported by the military as a "flying disc." The subsequent retraction, claiming it was a weather balloon, serves as an early example of government [**disinformation**](outcomes.md) aimed at managing public perception.
* **1948**: The U.S. Air Force initiates [**Project Sign**](../../themes/technology.md) to investigate UFO sightings, which includes an internal report suggesting some sightings may indicate extraterrestrial origins. The report is dismissed, reflecting a pattern of minimizing public concern.

## **1950s**

* **1952**:
  * [**Washington D.C. UFO Incident**](broken-reference): Multiple sightings lead to heightened public interest and concern. The CIA's [**Robertson Panel**](broken-reference) advises debunking UFO reports to prevent mass hysteria, marking a strategic use of disinformation.
* **1953**: The CIA encourages the Air Force to use [**Project Blue Book**](../../TECHNOLOGY/AI_AUTOPILOT.MD) as a means of publicly discrediting UFO sightings while simultaneously covering up advanced military projects.

## **1960s**

* **1966**: Project Blue Book is officially established to investigate UFO reports. However, it becomes increasingly clear that its role is more about public relations and debunking than genuine investigation, aligning with psyops strategies to control narratives.

## **1970s**

* **1976**: Reports emerge of military personnel conducting psychological operations related to UFOs. This includes disinformation campaigns aimed at manipulating public belief in extraterrestrial phenomena.

## **1980s**

* **1981**: The [**Bennewitz Affair**](../UFOS/bennewitz_affair.mdmd) occurs, where the U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) engages in a targeted psyop against Paul Bennewitz, feeding him false information about extraterrestrial activity and secret military projects to divert his attention from actual classified operations.

## **1990s**

* **1994**: The U.S. Air Force releases a report on the Roswell Incident, framing it as a weather balloon incident while omitting details about military secrecy and advanced technology development, further exemplifying the use of disinformation.

## **2000s**

* **2007**: The establishment of the [**Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP)**](emergency_fund.md) reflects ongoing government interest in UAPs but also suggests continued secrecy and potential disinformation regarding the nature of these phenomena.

## **2010s**

* **2017**: The release of videos showing UAP encounters by Navy pilots sparks renewed interest and speculation about government cover-ups. This aligns with historical patterns of using media narratives to shape public perception.

## **2020s**

* **2021**:
  * The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) releases a preliminary assessment on UAPs, acknowledging numerous sightings but failing to provide conclusive evidence or transparency about their origins.
* **2022**:
  * The establishment of the [**All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO)**](electromagnetic_gravity_coupling.md) aims to consolidate UAP investigations across military branches but faces criticism for lack of transparency and ongoing disinformation practices.
* **2023**:
  * Whistleblower [**David Grusch**](../DAVID_GRUSCH.md) testifies before Congress alleging that the government possesses non-human spacecraft and has engaged in reverse-engineering efforts. His claims highlight ongoing concerns about disinformation campaigns aimed at managing public belief in extraterrestrial life.
  * Reports indicate that government officials continue to dismiss credible witness accounts while promoting narratives that align with established psyops strategies.
