# DESCI

**Decentralized Science (DeSci)** refers to the application of [blockchain](../CRYPTO/CRYPTOCURRENCIES.MD) and decentralized technologies—such as [smart contracts](../TECHNOLOGY/smart_contracts.md), [decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)](daos.md), and [tokenized incentive structures](../CRYPTO/tokens.md)—to various stages of scientific research. This includes funding, experimentation, data sharing, peer review, and publication.

DeSci aims to:

* Remove [siloed](broken-reference) barriers in the traditional scientific process.
* Leverage [open-source](../space/nasa.md) collaboration.
* Enable transparent governance through distributed ledgers.
* Foster new economic models for incentivizing large-scale research.

### Recent Developments in DeSci

Below are highlights of notable activities and advancements in DeSci over the past few years:

1. **Emergence of Specialized DeSci DAOs**
   * [**VitaDAO**](https://www.vitadao.com/): Focuses on [longevity research](vault.md) and raises funds via token mechanisms, granting contributors governance rights over project selection.
   * **Molecule**: Facilitates the tokenization of [intellectual property (IP)](technical_writing.md) in biotech research, creating fractional ownership and liquidity for scientific assets.
2. **Accelerated Crowdfunding for Scientific Research**
   * **NFT-Based Fundraising**: Some DeSci communities experiment with [non-fungible tokens (NFTs)](nfts.md) representing partial ownership or acknowledgment in research outcomes.
   * **Global Participation**: Crowdfunding from diverse geographies and demographics bypasses traditional barriers (e.g., academic grants), accelerating the pace of research funding.
3. **Development of Data Infrastructure**
   * **Federated Learning & Privacy-Preserving Tech**: Projects increasingly use [zero-knowledge proofs](../TECHNOLOGY/zero_knowledge_proofs.md) and [homomorphic encryption](../HOMOMORPHIC_ENCRYPTION.md) to handle sensitive [patient](../strategy/economic_threshold.md) and genomic data, ensuring compliance with regulations (e.g., [GDPR](../GDPR.md), [HIPAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act)).
   * **Universal Citation & Data Linking**: Multiple initiatives aim to create a decentralized [citation chain](../AI/citation_chain.md) for peer-reviewed studies, open data sets, and community-driven preprints.
4. **Integration with Traditional Academia**
   * **Hybrid Models**: Universities and research institutes increasingly explore bridging [DeFi](../CRYPTO/DEFI.MD) and DeSci. Some labs experiment with token-based membership to fund expansions or scholarship programs.
   * **Institutional Interest**: [Pension funds](pension_funds.md) and [sovereign wealth funds](broken-reference) show early-stage curiosity in DeSci, though legal and [regulatory environments](../governance/regulatory_environments.md) remain a major consideration.
5. **Open Peer Review Protocols**
   * **DAO-Governed Review**: DeSci DAOs experiment with token-based reputation systems, staking mechanisms, and decentralized [peer review](../PEER_REVIEW_PROTOCOLS.md) to reduce bias and reward quality feedback.
   * **Transparent Workflow**: Protocols log revisions, citations, and commentary on-chain, creating immutable records of the review process.

### Notable Conferences & Community Events

* **DeSci Berlin 2022**: A gathering focused on bridging the blockchain community and scientific innovators. Presentations highlighted the potential for decentralized genomic research, open data repositories, and new incentive layers for academics.
* **ETHDenver**: Continues to host DeSci panels and hackathons that bring together [Web3](../WEB3.md) developers and researchers seeking to build novel collaboration tools.

### Future Outlook

* **Scaling to Billions**: There is significant momentum to incorporate [billions of patient participants](../HUMANS/billions_participants.mdcipants.md) in global digital therapeutics studies, leveraging blockchain for secure data sharing and compensation.
* **Regulatory Pathways**: As DeSci projects mature, they must navigate evolving securities and health-data regulations. Early positioning can facilitate future partnerships with large-scale institutions.
* **AI Collaboration**: The integration of advanced [AI models](evolutionary_destiny.md) with open, decentralized scientific databases may enable automated hypothesis generation and more efficient meta-analyses.
