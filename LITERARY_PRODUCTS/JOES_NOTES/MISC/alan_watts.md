# ALAN\_WATTS

[**Alan Watts**](alan_watts.md) faced several health and personal challenges leading up to his death in [1973](../history/1973.md). While the immediate cause of his passing was a [**heart attack**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_attack), there were underlying factors that contributed to his declining health:

1. [**Alcoholism**](exabits_tge.md): Alan Watts struggled with alcohol abuse for much of his adult life. His heavy drinking was well-documented and is believed to have had a significant impact on his physical health, potentially contributing to his heart problems.
2. [**Mental Health**](broken-reference): Watts experienced periods of [depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_\(mood\)) and [existential anxiety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_anxiety), which were reflected in his writings and lectures. These mental health challenges may have exacerbated his reliance on alcohol as a coping mechanism.
3. [**Lifestyle Factors**](broken-reference): The lifestyle associated with his career—extensive traveling, irregular routines, and the stresses of [public speaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_speaking) and writing—likely took a toll on his overall well-being.
4. [**Health Awareness**](broken-reference): During the time Watts lived, there was less awareness and fewer resources available for dealing with [addiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction) and mental health issues. This lack of support may have made it more difficult for him to manage his health effectively.

These factors combined created a complex situation that ultimately affected his longevity. Despite these struggles, Alan Watts left behind a profound legacy through his exploration of [Eastern philosophy](ownership_distribution.md), [spirituality](broken-reference), and [psychology](broken-reference), continuing to inspire and influence many to this day.
