**Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)** are unique digital assets stored on a blockchain that represent ownership of a specific item or piece of content. While initially popularized in the art, gaming, and collectibles industries, NFTs hold significant potential in **assetizing and tokenizing professional experience profiles and skill sets**. By integrating **DeFi (Decentralized Finance)** technologies, professionals across industries can leverage NFTs to validate, monetize, and trade their expertise and accomplishments.
