## 1. Dr. Edwin C. May’s Background

- **Academic Training**  
  - Holds a Ph.D. in Experimental Nuclear Physics.  
  - Transitioned from nuclear physics to psi (parapsychology) research in the mid-1970s.

- **Entry Into ESP Research**  
  - First encountered psychokinesis (mind-over-matter) experiments at the University of California, Davis, trying to measure mental influence on sensitive pendulums.  
  - Skeptical beginnings but later engaged with parapsychology conferences and research at Maimonides Medical Center (notably dream telepathy studies).

- **Role in Government Projects**  
  - Became a consultant at SRI (Stanford Research Institute) in 1975; joined full-time in 1979.  
  - Assumed directorship of the Stargate program in 1985, presiding over its US government–funded ESP/remote viewing activities until the program ended in 1995.

## 2. Remote Viewing (RV) Foundations and Methodology

- **Definition and General Protocol**  
  - Remote viewing: Gathering information about a distant or unseen target through extrasensory means.  
  - Typically employs a “double-blind” protocol: neither the remote viewer nor the interviewer (monitor) knows the target until after the session, preventing normal sensory or cueing pathways.

- **Example of an Aptitude Test**  
  - Dr. May administered a brief remote-viewing-style test to the host (Sean) during the interview.  
  - The protocol: “Please access and describe the photograph I will show you in ~10–15 minutes.”  
  - Emphasis on avoiding “noise” (e.g., ignoring images of indoor scenes or people, since the target pool is purely outdoor photos).

- **Scoring and Fuzzy Set Analysis**  
  - Uses a mathematical model (fuzzy sets) to compare the participant’s description with a pre-coded target database.  
  - Produces metrics such as “accuracy” (percent of target elements perceived) and “relevance” (percent of response matching the actual target).  
  - Enables quantitative assessment of performance in single trials and across large datasets.

- **Skepticism, Feedback, and the Importance of Controls**  
  - Continuous emphasis on “feedback” to the viewer (viewing a real photograph or physically traveling to the site) to confirm or refute the accuracy of an RV session.  
  - Frequent mention of potential sources of error, cheating, or unconscious cueing; protocols are designed to eliminate such “leakage.”

## 3. Historical Overview of Government-Funded Research

- **Origins of Stargate / Predecessor Programs**  
  - Early 1970s: CIA and other agencies began funding SRI after hearing of promising results (e.g., Ingo Swann’s demonstrations, interest in Soviet psychical research).  
  - Over the program’s lifetime, funding shifted among agencies:  
    - CIA (early),  
    - Air Force Foreign Technology Division (FTD),  
    - Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA),  
    - Army Medical Research & Development Command, etc.

- **Nature of the Work**  
  - **Operational Taskings**: Intelligence agencies often asked for “actionable” RV sessions—e.g., describing potential directed-energy installations or weapons R&D.  
  - **Research vs. Operations**: Dr. May repeatedly lamented that most funding was directed at operational tasks (solving intelligence problems) rather than core scientific studies about mechanisms.  
  - **Verification of Success**: Government “end users” often returned with additional taskings when the RV data proved helpful or intriguing, despite the phenomenon’s inherent noise and partial failures.

- **Oversight Committees**  
  - Multiple committees (scientific, policy, and medical) monitored the project’s protocols.  
  - Included Nobel laureates and senior scientists who demanded rigorous design and data analysis.  
  - Committees sought to rule out mundane explanations like “sensory leakage” or improper randomization.

- **Program Closure (1995)**  
  - Official reason often attributed to a CIA-commissioned review by the American Institutes of Research (AIR).  
  - Dr. May’s later analysis (and CIA’s own declassified documents) suggests the shutdown primarily resulted from wider intelligence budget cuts after the Cold War, not purely from negative scientific evaluations.

## 4. Major Experiments and Illustrative Results

- **Directed Energy Facility Descriptions**  
  - Joe McMoneagle, a top remote viewer, accurately described aspects of high-powered microwave and electron-beam installations (e.g., “Project ROSE”), along with supporting sketches that matched site geometry.  
  - These successes impressed certain sponsors but did not unify broader management support.

- **Planetary Remote Viewing**  
  - Historical anecdotes include Ingo Swann’s purported RV of Jupiter’s rings before NASA’s photographic confirmation.  
  - Dr. May remains cautious: you cannot truly confirm such unfeedbacked targets (like “Mars at 1 million BC”)—they fall outside strict scientific confirmability.

- **Dream Telepathy (Maimonides) and Ganzfeld**  
  - Early-lab findings in the 1970s suggested that “reducing sensory input” (via sleep or the Ganzfeld technique) can enhance telepathy or clairvoyance.  
  - Not extensively pursued by Dr. May’s team at SRI (their focus was predominantly remote viewing and some psychokinesis experiments).

- **Psychokinesis Research**  
  - Studied possible PK on bacterial mutation rates (e.g., Salmonella), but favored an alternative explanation that “remote viewers” might simply be psychically choosing test tubes already likely to mutate (a “decision augmentation” effect), rather than actually altering them.

## 5. International Collaborations and Observations

- **Russia (Post-1992)**  
  - Dr. May visited Moscow multiple times; befriended ex-KGB and military researchers involved in Soviet psychic programs.  
  - Learned of large-scale training (claims of 120 remote viewers) but received minimal concrete data-sharing in return.  
  - Mutual interest in joint research (e.g., anti-terror RV), but US leadership never acted on proposals.

- **China**  
  - Invited to a conference in Hong Kong featuring children allegedly trained in “teleportation” and “psychic spoon bending.”  
  - Found demonstrations poorly controlled and often indistinguishable from trickery or illusions.  
  - Deemed it “child abuse” when children were pressured to succeed at impossible tasks.

## 6. Dr. May’s Scientific Position on Key Psi Claims

1. **Remote Viewing**  
   - Convinced it’s real, with ~1% of the population demonstrating above-chance skills under lab conditions.  
   - Emphasizes the challenge of deciphering *mechanisms*—precognition and entropy-based models are explored but remain unproven.

2. **Telepathy**  
   - Argues that classical “mind-to-mind” telepathy cannot be separated from precognitive or clairvoyant information channels without a definitive “no-feedback” condition (e.g., the “kill-yourself” thought experiment).

3. **Survival of Consciousness**  
   - Sides with the “physicalist” view that consciousness is an emergent property of the brain; does not survive bodily death.  
   - Distinguishes between *informational mediumship* (getting data via ESP) and *physical mediumship* (e.g., levitation of objects), the latter he largely dismisses as fraud or illusions.

4. **Psychokinesis**  
   - Macro-PK (e.g., large-scale levitations) unverified under robust controls; micro-PK might be better explained via “decision augmentation” rather than direct causation.

5. **Other Claims (e.g., healing, dream telepathy)**  
   - Encourages strict controls, time-stamped feedback, robust randomization to rule out normal biases.

## 7. Unanswered Questions and Future Directions

- **Mechanism of PSI**  
  - Dr. May highlights two major unknowns:
    1. **Physics**: The possibility of “retrocausal” information carriers (e.g., quantum-based signals traveling backward in time).  
    2. **Neuroscience**: Identification of any specialized structure or “cross-talk” phenomenon in the brain’s white matter enabling psi perception.

- **Implications for Intelligence Work**  
  - Maintains that remote viewing, though noisy, can augment conventional methods without putting human operatives at risk.  
  - Believes institutional and cultural stigma prevent new large-scale government sponsorship.

- **Ongoing Research**  
  - Collaborative EEG/fMRI or MRI-based investigations in Brazil, aimed at pinpointing neurological markers in exceptionally skilled RV practitioners (e.g., Angela Ford).  
  - Hopes advanced imaging might one day reveal the elusive “psi channel” in the brain.

- **Ethical/Practical Issues**  
  - Highlights psychological strain on certain individuals unable to compartmentalize psi experiences.  
  - Urges younger scientists to first acquire strong credentials in established fields—then rigorously apply those methods to parapsychology.

## 8. Closing Reflections

- **Cultural and Scientific Resistance**  
  - Despite extensive operational successes and methodologically robust data, psi research remains an outlier due to fear of “the unknown,” religious objections, or entrenched skepticism.

- **Advice and Perspective**  
  - Dr. May’s decades of study suggest focusing on incrementally refined, double-blind, feedback-driven designs.  
  - Encourages the next generation of researchers to probe the phenomenon’s physics (possibly quantum retrocausation) and neurobiological substrates—two complementary domains for unlocking the puzzle of human psi.

### Key Takeaways

1. **Remote Viewing is Reproducible**  
   - While imperfect, it yielded statistically and operationally significant results (e.g., describing undisclosed sites, technologies).

2. **Core Scientific Rigor**  
   - Strict attention to feedback loops, randomization, and anti-cheating protocols sets this research apart from anecdotal claims.

3. **Precognition as a Unifying Hypothesis**  
   - Much of the evidence can be reframed as “peeking into” future feedback (a potential subset of broader quantum retrocausation).

4. **Unresolved Mechanisms**  
   - No firm consensus on how information physically transits from target to perceiver, nor how the brain translates it into a cognitive percept.

5. **Programmatic End**  
   - Stargate concluded in 1995, likely due to post–Cold War budget restructurings, not solely due to negative scientific reviews.

In sum, Dr. Edwin C. May’s conversation offers a deep and candid look at parapsychology from a rigorous experimental vantage. While substantial data endorse the reality of remote viewing, the “how” and “why” remain open scientific frontiers, bridging physics, physiology, and consciousness studies.
