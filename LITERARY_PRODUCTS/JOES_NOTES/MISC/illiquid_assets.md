# Illiquid Assets

## Definition
Illiquid assets are assets that are not easily sold, traded, or converted into cash without a significant loss in value. These assets often lack a liquid market and are typically held for longer periods due to their specialized nature or limited demand. In the context of careers, **illiquid careers** parallel illiquid assets by representing non-traditional or unconventional paths where skills and achievements are harder to quantify and trade.

With advancements in **DeFi (Decentralized Finance)** technologies, the concept of **assetizing and tokenizing professional experience profiles and skill sets** can help bridge the gap between illiquidity and liquidity, creating opportunities for greater visibility and value realization.
