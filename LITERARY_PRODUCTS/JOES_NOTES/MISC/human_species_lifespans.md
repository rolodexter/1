# HUMAN\_SPECIES\_LIFESPANS

[Homo sapiens](homo_sapiens.md) are estimated to have first appeared approximately **300,000 to 315,000 years ago**. This indicates that as of [January 2025](broken-reference), [Homo sapiens](homo_sapiens.md) has been around for about **300,000 years**.

* The oldest known fossils attributed to [Homo sapiens](homo_sapiens.md) date to around **315,000 years ago** from [Jebel Irhoud](jebel_irhdoud.md) in [Morocco](../MOROCCO.md), which suggests that modern humans were present in [Africa](../HUMANS/AFRICA.MD/AFRICA.MD) much earlier than previously thought.
* Other significant finds include fossils from [Omo Kibish](omo_kibish.md), [Ethiopia](../ETHIOPIA.md), dated to about **195,000 years ago**, and the [Florisbad skull](../FLORISBAD_SKULL.md) from [South Africa](../SOUTH_AFRICA.md), dating to around **259,000 years ago**.
* The [divergence](divergence.md) of [Homo sapiens](homo_sapiens.md) from other [hominin lineages](hominin_lineages.md) is estimated to have occurred between **350,000 and 260,000 years ago**, supporting the idea that modern humans emerged as a distinct species during this timeframe.
* **Total Number of Homo sapiens Who Have Ever Lived:** It is estimated that over **100 billion** individuals of [Homo sapiens](homo_sapiens.md) have lived and died up to [January 2025](broken-reference). This estimate takes into account the long history of our species and the exponential growth in population over recent millennia.
