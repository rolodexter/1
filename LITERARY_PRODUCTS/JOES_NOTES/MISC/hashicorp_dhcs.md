# HASHICORP\_DHCS

The [**California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS)**](../DHCS.md) adopted the following key technologies from **HashiCorp** to [modernize its legacy healthcare infrastructure](https://www.hashicorp.com/assets/1717630359-casestudy_cadhcs.pdf):

* [**Terraform Cloud**](TERRAFORM.MD): This was the cornerstone of DHCS's modernization efforts. Terraform allowed DHCS to standardize their infrastructure, automate resource provisioning, and significantly reduce the time required to deploy new environments from weeks to hours. It enabled the organization to create reusable code modules for infrastructure management, resulting in a more agile and efficient deployment process.
* [**Vault**](broken-reference): Although not immediately implemented, DHCS plans to incorporate Vault as part of their solution in the future. Vault is designed for secrets management, providing a secure way to manage sensitive data such as API keys and passwords, which is crucial for compliance and security in healthcare applications.

These technologies collectively helped DHCS achieve greater visibility and control over its infrastructure, improved service delivery timelines, and laid a foundation for supporting up to 200 applications in the future. The automation and scalability offered by HashiCorp's solutions have been pivotal in enhancing operational efficiency within the department.
