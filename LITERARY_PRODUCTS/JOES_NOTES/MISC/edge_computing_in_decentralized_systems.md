# Edge Computing in Decentralized Systems

## Overview
**Edge computing** refers to the deployment of computation and data storage resources closer to the source of data generation, rather than relying on centralized data centers. In decentralized systems, edge computing plays a critical role in improving performance, reducing latency, and enhancing data privacy. It complements blockchain and distributed networks by enabling localized decision-making and efficient resource allocation.
