# Shared Prosperity: An Inclusive Vision for the AI Era

**Shared Prosperity** refers to the equitable distribution of benefits and opportunities created by technological and societal advancements. In the context of artificial intelligence (AI), shared prosperity ensures that the transformative power of AI contributes to the well-being of all, rather than deepening inequalities or concentrating wealth and influence in the hands of a few.

### **3. Bias and Discrimination**
- Unrepresentative training datasets can lead to biased AI systems that reinforce societal inequities.
- **Solution**: Incorporating diverse datasets and conducting fairness audits in AI development.

### **4. Technological Displacement**
- Automation threatens traditional jobs, disproportionately impacting low-skilled workers.
- **Solution**: Proactive investment in reskilling and social safety nets.
