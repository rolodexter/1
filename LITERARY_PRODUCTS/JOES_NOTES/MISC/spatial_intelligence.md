# Spatial Intelligence

Spatial Intelligence refers to the capacity to perceive, understand, and manipulate the spatial relationships between objects in both physical and digital environments. It is a cornerstone of human cognition and plays a vital role in how we interact with and navigate the world. In the context of artificial intelligence (AI), spatial intelligence enables machines to understand, reason, and act within 3D spaces, bridging the gap between the physical and digital realms.
