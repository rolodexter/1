## **Key Challenges in Confidential AI Training**

### 1. **Data Privacy:**
   - Ensuring sensitive information, such as personal identifiable information (PII) or proprietary data, is not exposed during training.

### 2. **Regulatory Compliance:**
   - Adhering to privacy regulations like **GDPR**, **CCPA**, and **HIPAA**, which restrict how data is processed and shared.

### 3. **Security Risks:**
   - Protecting data from unauthorized access, theft, or leakage during training.

### 4. **Model Inversion Attacks:**
   - Preventing adversaries from reconstructing training data by analyzing trained models.

### 5. **Scalability:**
   - Managing the computational overhead introduced by confidentiality-preserving techniques when training large models.
