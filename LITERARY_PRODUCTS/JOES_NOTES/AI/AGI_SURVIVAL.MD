# AGI as a Prerequisite for Human Survival

I'm increasingly convinced that it's not just a technological milestone, but an evolutionary imperative for our species. Here's my current thinking on why AGI is crucial for human survival and transcendence:

## Path Dependence Analysis

Our technological and cognitive development follows a path-dependent process. I model it as:

$$ H(t) = f(H(t-1), T(t), E(t)) $$

Where:
- $H(t)$ is human capabilities at time t
- $T(t)$ is technological advancements
- $E(t)$ is environmental pressures

*[Note to self: Explore how social structures and cultural evolution might fit into this model. Discuss with the anthropology team at ParkHealth.]*

Historically, $H(t)$ was constrained by biological evolution, with $T(t)$ as an augmentation. But as we approach AGI, I see a potential phase transition where $T(t)$ becomes the primary driver of human capability growth.

## Evolutionary Velocity

I've been modeling the velocity of evolutionary change:

$$ V_e = \frac{dF}{dt} $$

Where $V_e$ is evolutionary velocity and $F$ is fitness.

For biological evolution:

$$ V_b = \frac{dF_b}{dt} = k_b \cdot G \cdot S $$

Where:
- $V_b$ is biological evolutionary velocity
- $k_b$ is a constant
- $G$ is genetic variation
- $S$ is selection pressure

For technological evolution with AGI:

$$ V_t = \frac{dF_t}{dt} = k_t \cdot I \cdot R $$

Where:
- $V_t$ is technological evolutionary velocity
- $k_t$ is a constant
- $I$ is innovation rate
- $R$ is resource availability

*[Note: Need to incorporate non-linear terms to better represent complex dynamics. Discuss with the math team.]*

The key insight is that $V_t$ has the potential to far exceed $V_b$, especially as AGI accelerates the innovation rate $I$.

## AGI as an Evolutionary Necessity

I frame the necessity of AGI in terms of a critical threshold:

$$ \frac{E_c}{H_c} > 1 $$

Where $E_c$ is environmental complexity and $H_c$ is human cognitive capacity.

As $E_c$ increases exponentially due to climate change, geopolitical instability, and technological risks, $H_c$ must grow at a commensurate rate to ensure survival. AGI presents a pathway to rapidly increase $H_c$ beyond biological limits.

## Computational Threshold for AGI and Human Transcendence

Building on our economic threshold concept, I model the relationship between computational power and cognitive enhancement:

$$ H_c(t) = H_b + \alpha \cdot C(t)^\beta $$

Where:
- $H_b$ is baseline human cognitive capacity
- $C(t)$ is available compute at time t
- $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are constants

*[Note: Consider adding error terms to account for uncertainties. Discuss potential upper limits with the neuroscience team.]*

As $C(t)$ approaches the AGI threshold, there's potential for a phase transition where $H_c(t)$ experiences exponential growth, enabling us to transcend biological limitations.

## Decentralization as a Catalyst

The decentralization of compute resources is crucial. By democratizing access to AI compute, we increase the probability of breakthrough innovations:

$$ P(AGI) = 1 - (1 - p)^N $$

Where:
- $P(AGI)$ is the probability of achieving AGI
- $p$ is the probability of a single research effort succeeding
- $N$ is the number of independent research efforts

*[Note: Need to account for varying qualities of research efforts. Consider modeling collaboration effects.]*

Decentralization increases $N$, significantly boosting $P(AGI)$.

## Other Notes

These models demonstrate that the velocity of technological evolution, particularly with AGI, has the potential to far outpace biological evolution. This acceleration is necessary for us to overcome increasing environmental complexity and transcend the limitations of natural selection.

AGI, facilitated by critical computational thresholds and decentralized resources, represents a pivotal moment in human history. It's our pathway to take control of our evolutionary destiny, ensuring not just survival, but a transformative leap in our cognitive capabilities and problem-solving capacity.
