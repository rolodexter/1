# Tradeable Compute: Transforming Compute into Highly Liquid Assets

A future where [compute resources](../../encyclopedia/COMPUTE_RESOURCES.md) are universally tradeable and highly liquid is inevitable: and that future is near. Advanced [tokenization](../../encyclopedia/TOKENIZATION.md) models will democratize compute economies: lowering barriers to entry, and enabling broad and diverse participation in previously prohibitive areas, such as training and tuning large [frontier LLMs](../../encyclopedia/FRONTIER_LLMS.md) or even [supercomputational simulations](../misc/cloud_providers.md).

## [Universally Tradeable Compute](../../encyclopedia/UTC.md) (UTCs)

### Key Features

* [**Standardization**](../MISC/ALCOHOLISM.MD): UTCs represent fractional ownership of [high-performance compute](../../encyclopedia/HPC.md) infrastructure, including [GPU hours](../../encyclopedia/GPU_HOURS.md), [NPU cycles](../../encyclopedia/NPU_CYCLES.md), and [quantum processing units](../../encyclopedia/QPU.md).
* [**Operational Value**](compute_finance.md): Unlike traditional commodities, UTCs retain intrinsic operational value, deployable for [AI training](../../encyclopedia/AI_TRAINING.md) and [inference](../../encyclopedia/INFERENCE.md) tasks upon transaction settlement.

### Integration with Financial Markets

* [**Smart Contracts**](../history/montreal_protocol.md): Govern [resource allocation](../../encyclopedia/RESOURCE_ALLOCATION.md) and settlement processes, ensuring real-time provisioning of purchased compute resources.
* [**Liquid Markets**](../../ENCYCLOPEDIA/unsupervised_superintelligence.md): UTCs are tradeable on [decentralized exchanges](../../encyclopedia/DEX.md) (DEXs) and [centralized exchanges](../../encyclopedia/CEX.md) (CEXs), transforming compute resources into liquid financial assets.

## High-Level Operative Components

### Smart Contract Integration

* [**Automated Settlement**](../../ENCYCLOPEDIA/logistics.md): Ensures instantaneous clearing and dynamic resource allocation post-transaction.
* [**SLA Modularization Framework**](../history/manhattan_project.md): Decomposes [SLAs](../../encyclopedia/SLA.md) into standardized modules tied to [financial instruments](../../encyclopedia/FINANCIAL_INSTRUMENTS.md), ensuring compliance and performance guarantees.

### [Resource Federation Layer](../../encyclopedia/RFL.md) (RFL)

* [**Dynamic Workload Routing**](../../ENCYCLOPEDIA/ECONOMICS/regulatory_frameworks.md): Optimizes resource allocation across diverse hardware types.
