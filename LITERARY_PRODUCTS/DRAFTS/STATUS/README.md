## Interface Schema Development
Development is progressing on our comprehensive interface schema framework, designed to accelerate frontend development and deployment processes. Key aspects include:

- Standardization of frontend elements across all applications and products
- Implementation of modular component architecture
- Focus on scalability and cross-platform uniformity
- Integration with Web3-enabled infrastructure

## rolodexter System Architecture
rolodexter operates as a sophisticated top-down executive intelligence system that:

- Manages high-level executive knowledge and strategic decision-making
- Orchestrates deployment of capabilities through a hierarchical intelligence structure
- Leverages and coordinates lower-layer intelligence systems (LLMs, copilot agents) for specialized tasks
- Optimizes resource allocation by delegating operational tasks to mature, specialized intelligence layers

This architecture enables efficient execution of complex projects while maintaining strategic oversight and coordination across all system layers.
