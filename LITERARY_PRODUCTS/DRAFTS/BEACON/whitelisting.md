# WHITELISTING

**Access Protocol Update for Decentralized Broadcasting System**  
The initiative currently codenamed *Beacon* will implement strict access controls aligned with rolodexter's cryptoeconomic governance models.  

### **Whitelisting Mechanics**  

- **Exclusive Access**: Only verified holders of rolodexter's native token gain dApp entry through:  
  - Token-gated authentication at designated portal  
  - Automated Proof-of-Stake reputation scoring  
  - Dynamic whitelist updates via governance polls  

- **Verification Process**  

  ```solidity
  function checkWhitelist(address _user) public view returns (bool) {
      return IERC721(rolodexterToken).balanceOf(_user) > 0 
          && !revokedAddresses[_user];
  }
  ```
