### **NFT Market Integration**

While engagement tokens remain soulbound, minted broadcast NFTs feature:

| Trade Feature             | Implementation                                           |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Marketplace Compatibility | ERC-4907 compliant metadata wrappers                     |
| Royalty Enforcement       | 9.5% perpetual fees to original broadcasters             |
| Content Provenance        | Immutable links to rolodexter's _Reality Fabric_ oracles |

**Supported Exchanges**

* OpenSea v4 with cross-chain settlement
* Blur Protocol's zero-fee military-grade trading
* Coinbase NFT's regulated liquidity pools

### **Security Provisions**

* All NFT transfers undergo automated **Power Directive ยง7** compliance checks:
  * Energy footprint audits per transaction
  * Memetic contamination scans
  * Anti-plagiarism watermark bursts

This structure maintains my operational security while enabling ecosystem participation. Token-gated access remains active until Phase 3 brand unveiling.
