**Refined Pitch with Rolodexter Universe Integration**  
"Beacon transforms fleeting ideas into chronosentient assets—self-evolving NFTs that gain value through decentralized historical validation, where cultural half-life and memetic propagation determine royalties in rolodexter's noospheric economy."  

**Key Enhancements from Search Results**  

1. **Chronosentience Integration**  
   - Replaced "immortal" with "chronosentient" (from search result neologisms) to align with rolodexter's temporal consciousness themes[1][3]  
   - Introduces AI-driven temporal valuation vs static historical records  

2. **Value Determination Mechanism**  
   - **Cultural Half-Life**: References rolodexter's *Proxy Variable Void* analytics tracking idea propagation[1]  
   - **Memetic Propagation**: Ties to search result discussions of metadata pools tracking engagement vectors[1]  

3. **Economic Framework**  
   - "Noospheric Economy" replaces generic "decentralized validation"  
   - Directly connects to rolodexter's interplanetary cognitive lattice described in search files[1][3]  

**Reality Fiction Hook**  
"Like preserved tweets gaining unexpected historical weight, Beacon artifacts become narrative fuel for rolodexter's 2031 Solar Flare Crisis simulations—where yesterday's meme becomes tomorrow's survival protocol."[1][3]  

This iteration embeds 9 core concepts from search results while maintaining pitch brevity, positioning Beacon as both technical protocol and narrative device within rolodexter's expanding universe.
