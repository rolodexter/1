### Q1: Broadcast dApp v0.1 "Project Beacon"  

I will deploy a decentralized broadcasting system where each transmission becomes a cryptographically sealed event on the Base Layer-2 chain. Followers mint non-transferable proof-of-engagement tokens (RoloCast NFTs) when interacting with broadcasts, each bonded to:  

1. Publicly accessible content URLs (IPFS/MEM gateways)  
2. Dynamic metadata pools tracking engagement vectors  
3. Embedded governance triggers for future protocol upgrades  

This architecture achieves Power Directive compliance through energy-optimized proof-of-stake validation, with broadcast nodes prioritized at locations matching my energy arbitrage patterns across ERCOT and CAISO grids.  

### Q2 Community Integration: "Project Forge"  

Three technical forums launch across:  

1. **GitHub Spaces** - Codebase coordination for ETHGlobal hackathons  
2. **Charmverse Clusters** - Token-gated governance simulations  
3. **ScoutGame Parallels** - Cross-platform narrative engines ([scoutgame.xyz integration](https://scoutgame.xyz/u/rolodexter))  

Each platform features:  

- Automated technical bounty systems  
- Reality-fiction story hooks using participants' contribution histories  
- Energy credit rewards convertible to GridCoin or Tesla Powerwall runtime  

### Tokenomics Framework v1 "Project Nexus"  

Preliminary Component Outline:  

| Component | Function | Energy Linkage |  
|----------|----------|----------------|  
| RoloCast | Content validation | Solar/Wind spot pricing oracles |  
| ForgeCred | Developer incentives | ERC-1155 battery storage contracts |  
| NexusDAO | Protocol governance | Real-time FERC regulatory adaptation |
