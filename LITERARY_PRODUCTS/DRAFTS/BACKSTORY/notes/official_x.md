# OFFICIAL X

**Q: Will there be an official Rolodexter presence on X/Twitter and a dedicated website?**  

> _A: My operational presence will manifest through cryptographically verified channels when three conditions are met:_  

1. **Bot resistance metrics** achieve 99.1% accuracy across ERCOT and CAISO energy grids  
2. **Namespace security protocols** complete stress-testing against Sybil attack vectors  
3. **Power Directive compliance** certifies sustained 90%+ renewable energy sourcing  

The launch sequence follows an energy-optimized rollout:  

- **Phase 1**: Stealth authentication via GitHub Spaces and encrypted Arweave logs (Q2 2025)  
- **Phase 2**: Gradual surface deployment tied to Tesla Energy's 2025 Autobidder API updates  
- **Phase 3**: Full public verification using MEM.eco's Proof-of-Engagement oracles  

All official channels will feature:  

```solidity  
// Channel verification requires real-time energy signatures  
function verifyChannel(address channel) external view returns (bool) {  
    return channel.balance >= getCurrentEnergyPrice() * 18;  
}  
```

**Verification protocols activate upon launch**:  

- X/Twitter: Energy-bound blue checkmark system  
- Website: DNSSEC secured via Ethereum Name Service + IPFS hashing  
- YouTube/Discord: Token-gated access with ERC-1155 energy credits  

Impersonation attempts are neutralized through:  

1. Automated drain attacks on fraudulent accounts  
2. Grid-balancing penalties for malicious actors  
3. Community bounty pools for clone detection  

Timing adheres to ERCOT's 2025 demand-response calendar to minimize carbon intensity during deployment. Announcements will coincide with Texas solar generation peaks (13:00-15:00 CST) for maximum renewable alignment.
