# INT. ATHERTON ESTATE - GRAND ROOM - NIGHT

**"TEARS FALLING DOWN ON WALSH RD"**

The vast, empty grand hall of the [Atherton estate](../../literary_products/ENCYCLOPEDIA/liquid_markets.md) looms in silence. [Vaulted ceilings](../../literary_products/encyclopedia/VAULTED_CEILINGS.md) stretch overhead, their shadows deepening the room's eerie and oppressive grandeur.

In the center, a [grand piano](../../literary_products/ENCYCLOPEDIA/socioeconomic_mobility.md) rests under a faint sliver of moonlight streaming through tall windows. Plush chairs and sofas encircle a [cold, unlit fireplace](../../literary_products/screenplays/broken-reference/), untouched and shrouded in dust—a relic of a bygone era. Particles of dust drift lazily in the dim light, settling onto the surfaces of forgotten opulence.

_(Reference Image: The grand hall of the Atherton estate, bathed in dim moonlight, reveals the stark contrast between its opulent past and present desolation. Dust-laden furnishings and the imposing grand piano evoke a sense of lost time, while shadows cast by the vaulted ceilings heighten the foreboding atmosphere.)_

The only sound is a haunting melody playing on loop, filling the silence with its melancholic rhythm. The lyrics drift through the air, as if the estate itself is whispering:

_"Guess I’ll tell myself ‘Happy birthday,’ Drinkin’ champagne at a table for one.”_

[Joe](../../literary_products/encyclopedia/JOE.md), late 20s, sits at a makeshift [computer lab](../../literary_products/encyclopedia/COMPUTER_LAB.md) set up on a large wooden table in the corner of the room. A cluster of monitors surrounds him, casting his face in a cold, blue glow—a stark contrast to the warm but desolate ambiance of the estate.

The song’s chorus repeats, amplifying the isolation of the scene. Joe's gaze shifts from the scrolling lines of [code](../../literary_products/ENCYCLOPEDIA/michio_kaku.md) on his screens to the [grand piano](../../literary_products/ENCYCLOPEDIA/socioeconomic_mobility.md) across the room. His expression is unreadable, as though haunted by the presence of something—or someone—missing. For a fleeting moment, he seems poised to move toward it, but he doesn’t.

Nothing disturbs the silence.

Joe exhales heavily and slouches back into his chair. The flashing cursor on the screen blinks expectantly, but his hands remain motionless above the keyboard. Reflections of the blue light fragment across the monitors, breaking his face into pieces.

The lyrics play again, reverberating through the vast, empty hall:

_"Pour another cup, 'cause I'm all out of love…"_

Joe rubs his temples and looks around the room, the estate's hollow grandeur pressing down on him. It feels alive in its emptiness, a quiet yet relentless witness to his solitude.

The haunting melody continues to weave through the room’s darkness, a ghostly echo searching for something—or someone—that is no longer there.
