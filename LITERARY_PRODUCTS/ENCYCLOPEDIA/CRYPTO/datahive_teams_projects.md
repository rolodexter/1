# DataHive Teams & Projects

## Cross-Functional Team Management

In my role at DataHive, I successfully managed cross-functional teams that included members from innovative organizations such as 0G Labs, AltLayer, and leading NaaS providers like [P10node](https://ln1.datahive.p10node.com/) and NodeOps. This experience strengthened my ability to drive integration and collaboration across cutting-edge technologies and services.

## Technical Integration with 0G Labs

With 0G Labs, I led the technical integration of 0G's AIOS into DataHive's core storage protocol. I established [links between 0G's platforms and DataHive's adapters](https://x.com/andrexo131/status/1840735191142166621), enabling seamless interfacing with our intelligence and knowledge models. This integration was crucial in enhancing our system's capability and scalability.

## Collaboration with AltLayer

While [working with AltLayer](https://www.datahive.network/post/datahive-launches-testnet1-on-op-sepolia-facilitated-by-altlayer-advancing-integration-with-0g-aios), I coordinated projects focused on exploring and implementing layer-2 scaling solutions. These initiatives significantly improved transaction throughput and efficiency.

## Partnership with NaaS Providers

I collaborated with NaaS providers such as [P10node](https://github.com/datahiv3/ln1) and [NodeOps](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-SZL6ZpklAQ0ofjYwEQkAf0tHrhjxZ8A/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=111669319430294495371&rtpof=true&sd=true) to optimize node deployment and management. This partnership ensured that our infrastructure remained robust and flexible, meeting the growing demands of our client base.
