# DATAHIVE\_NODE\_SALE

### High-Level Operative Components

#### LN1 Node Sale (Legalese Node Version 1)

* **Current Status**: The first leg of the [**node sale**](https://datahive.webflow.io/nodes), the LN1 Node Sale, is actively underway.
* [**Node Types**](https://github.com/datahiv3/.github/blob/main/profile/docs/decentralized-nodes.md): Comprises four core node types, each with its own sale event and cycle.
* **Culmination**: All node sales will culminate in a [Token Generation Event (TGE)](../../JOES_NOTES/MISC/corporate_legal_structures.md) in 2025.

#### Core Node Types

1. [**Legalese Nodes**](../unsupervised_superintelligence.md):
   * Focus on legal data indexing and curation within the DataHive network.
   * Utilize AI-driven insights to process and store legal documents securely.
2. [**Consent Nodes**](../ECONOMICS/opportunity_cones.md):
   * Manage user permissions and consent across the ecosystem.
   * Ensure compliance with global privacy regulations like [GDPR](../../encyclopedia/GDPR.md).
3. [**Data Assetization Nodes**](../UFOS/project_blue_book.md):
   * Transform raw data into structured data assets for secure sharing or monetization.
   * Standardize data for enterprise or AI agent use.
4. [**Securitization Nodes**](broken-reference):
   * Algorithmically create securities from individual data assets of a certain theme.
   * Develop "index fund" type securities from baskets of data assets, enabling secure trading and utilization in compliance with legal frameworks.
