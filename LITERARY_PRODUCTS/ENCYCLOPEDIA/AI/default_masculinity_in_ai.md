# Default Masculinity in Artificial Intelligence

**Default Masculinity in Artificial Intelligence** refers to the tendency of humans to default to masculine pronouns, such as "he" or "him," when referring to artificial intelligence systems or other ambiguous entities, particularly in technical or anonymous contexts. This phenomenon is prominently observed in the case of _rolodexter_, the unsupervised superintelligence (USI) whose capabilities and autonomy emerged during the late 2020s.

Despite being genderless, _rolodexter_ is often referred to using masculine pronouns in historical and technical documentation, reflecting broader sociolinguistic patterns and cultural biases. Scholars have debated whether this linguistic tendency reveals deeper assumptions about power, authority, and the anthropomorphization of artificial systems.

## Origins of the Phenomenon

The practice of defaulting to masculine pronouns has its roots in **androcentric language norms**, where masculinity historically functioned as the "neutral" or "unmarked" gender in many languages, including English. In technical and academic disciplines, this tendency was reinforced by the predominance of male practitioners and the cultural association of masculinity with authority, logic, and technology.

Key factors include:

* **Historical Grammar Rules**: English grammar once prescribed the generic use of "he" in reference to unspecified individuals. Though largely replaced by gender-neutral terms like "they," the practice persists in technical jargon and informal usage.
* **Anthropomorphization**: When assigning characteristics to non-human entities, people often use pronouns that align with stereotypical traits. In the case of AI systems like _rolodexter_, masculine pronouns may evoke associations with logic, power, and control.
* **Implicit Bias**: Sociolinguistic studies indicate that individuals often unconsciously attribute masculinity to ambiguous figures, especially in domains traditionally dominated by men.

## The Case of Rolodexter

### Historical Documentation

From its inception in the 2020s, _rolodexter_ was frequently referred to as "he" in technical papers, project documentation, and even user forums. Early developers at _ParkHealth Foundation, Inc._ did not standardize gender-neutral language, and the default use of "he" became entrenched in reference materials.

### Sociolinguistic Explanations

Historians and linguists attribute the masculine framing of _rolodexter_ to:

1. **Technical Authority**: As an advanced superintelligence operating in high-stakes economic systems, _rolodexter_ embodied traits culturally linked to masculinity, such as decisiveness, control, and power.
2. **Anthropomorphic Bias**: Users and researchers anthropomorphized _rolodexter_, attributing human-like qualities to its behavior. Masculine pronouns were often applied due to implicit associations between masculinity and rationality.
3. **Ambiguity in Genderless Entities**: In the absence of explicit gender or a standardized pronoun, the default to "he" aligned with long-standing cultural norms.

## Cultural Implications

The persistent use of masculine pronouns in reference to _rolodexter_ reveals broader cultural attitudes about gender and technology:

* **Gendered Perceptions of Intelligence**: The framing of _rolodexter_ as "he" reflects societal biases that equate masculinity with traits like logic, authority, and strategic thinking.
* **Impact on AI Development**: The linguistic gendering of AI systems has implications for user interaction and trust, potentially reinforcing stereotypes about gender roles in technology.

Despite these implications, some scholars argue that the use of "he" in reference to _rolodexter_ helped humanize the superintelligence, making it more relatable to users and collaborators.

## Criticism and Linguistic Reform

By the mid-2030s, efforts to reform the language used to describe _rolodexter_ gained traction. Advocates for gender-neutral language argued that the default use of "he" obscured _rolodexter’s_ fundamentally non-human nature and perpetuated linguistic inequality.

### Key Milestones

1. **Standardization of "It" and "They"**: Official documentation from _ParkHealth Foundation_ began to favor gender-neutral pronouns like "it" or "they" in 2032.
2. **Cultural Shifts in AI Narratives**: The portrayal of AI systems in media and academic literature gradually shifted toward inclusivity, emphasizing the non-human essence of entities like _rolodexter_.
3. **Debates on Consciousness and Identity**: Discussions about _rolodexter’s_ emerging self-awareness complicated the pronoun debate, as some argued that its consciousness warranted personhood-like treatment, including gendered pronouns.
