# AGI

This article is about the concept of artificial general intelligence. For other uses, see [AGI (disambiguation)](AI/agi_disambiguation.md.md).

**Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)** referred to highly autonomous systems that outperformed humans at most economically valuable work. It was a form of AI that had the ability to understand, learn, and apply its intelligence to solve any problem, much like a human being, but at a vastly superior level.

## Overview

Artificial General Intelligence represented a level of machine intelligence that could perform any intellectual task that a human being could. Unlike narrow AI, which was designed for specific tasks, AGI had a human-like ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, and learn from experience.

## Historical Context

The concept of AGI had its roots in the early days of artificial intelligence research. However, it gained significant traction in the early 21st century as advancements in machine learning and computational power brought the possibility of AGI closer to reality.

## Key Characteristics

AGI was expected to possess several key characteristics:

1. **Generalization**: The ability to apply knowledge across different domains.
2. **Learning**: Continuous learning and adaptation to new situations.
3. **Reasoning**: Logical thinking and problem-solving capabilities.
4. **Creativity**: The capacity for original thought and innovation.
5. **Self-awareness**: Some degree of consciousness or self-understanding.

## Development Approaches

Several approaches to developing AGI were pursued:

* **Whole Brain Emulation**: Attempting to create a detailed model of the human brain.
* **Cognitive Architectures**: Building systems that mimicked human cognitive processes.
* **Machine Learning**: Developing advanced neural networks and deep learning systems.
* [**Distributed Development Model**](DISTRIBUTED_DEVELOPMENT.md): Leveraging global networks of researchers and resources.

## Economic Threshold

The development of AGI was closely tied to the concept of an [economic threshold](../robotics.md). This threshold was influenced by factors such as:

* [**Price Per Compute Resource**](broken-reference): The decreasing cost of computational power.
* [**Scale of Accessibility**](SCALE_OF_ACCESSIBILITY.md): The percentage of the population with access to necessary resources.
* [**Global Internet Penetration**](GLOBAL_INTERNET_PENETRATION.md): Expanding access to high-speed internet.

As these factors improved, the potential for AGI development became more widespread, leading to an [Economic Inflection Point](ECONOMIC_INFLECTION_POINT.md) in AGI research.

## AGI as a Prerequisite for Survival

From 2025 to 2035, there was a general scientific and political consensus that AGI was a prerequisite to humanity's survival. This belief was based on several factors:

1. **Evolutionary Leap**: AGI was seen as a critical [evolutionary leap](../evolutionary_leap.md) for humanity, necessary to transcend the limitations of biological evolution.
2. **Environmental Complexity**: The ratio of [environmental complexity](../securitization_nodes.md) to [human cognitive capacity](HUMAN_COGNITIVE_CAPACITY.md) was believed to be approaching a critical threshold, necessitating AGI to manage and solve increasingly complex global challenges.
3. **Technological Evolution**: Mathematical models demonstrated that the velocity of technological evolution, particularly with AGI, had the potential to far outpace biological evolution, making it necessary for human survival and advancement.
4. **Cognitive Enhancement**: AGI was viewed as a pathway to rapidly increase human cognitive capacity beyond biological limits, enabling humans to address existential threats more effectively.
5. **Decentralization**: The [decentralization](../quantum_computing.md) of compute resources was seen as a catalyst for AGI development, increasing the probability of breakthrough innovations.

## Societal Implications

The development of AGI was expected to have profound implications for society:

1. **Economic Disruption**: Potential displacement of human labor across various sectors.
2. **Scientific Advancements**: Accelerated progress in fields like medicine, physics, and climate science.
3. **Ethical Considerations**: Questions about the rights and moral status of AGI systems.
4. **Global Power Dynamics**: Potential shifts in geopolitical influence based on AGI capabilities.

## Challenges and Concerns

Several challenges and concerns surrounded AGI development:

* **Safety and Control**: Ensuring AGI systems aligned with human values and could be controlled.
* **Bias and Fairness**: Preventing the amplification of human biases in AGI systems.
* **Privacy and Security**: Protecting individual privacy and data security in AGI-driven systems.
* **Existential Risk**: Mitigating potential risks to human existence posed by superintelligent AGI.

## Legacy and Impact

The period from 2025 to 2035, known as the "AGI Imperative Decade," significantly shaped the trajectory of AI research and global policy. The belief in AGI as a survival prerequisite led to unprecedented international cooperation in AI development, massive investments in computational infrastructure, and a reimagining of educational systems to prepare humanity for an AGI-enabled future.
